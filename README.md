# Airplane Information

This repository contains a C program that defines a `Plane` structure to store information about different types of airplanes. The program initializes an array of `Plane` structs and prints out details for each airplane.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) installed to compile and run the program.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc
```

### Compilation

Compile the program using the following command:

```bash
gcc airplane_info.c -o airplane_info
```

### Execution

Run the compiled program to display airplane information:

```bash
./airplane_info
```

## Program Output

The program will output information about 10 different airplanes, including their names, plane numbers, introduction ages, and capacities.

### Sample Output

```
THIS IS INFORMATION ON PLANE BOEING 747

PLANE NAME: BOEING 747
PLANE NUMBER: B747
PLANE AGE: INTRODUCED IN 1970s
PLANE CAPACITY: 660 PASSENGERS

THIS IS INFORMATION ON PLANE AIRBUS A380

PLANE NAME: AIRBUS A380
PLANE NUMBER: A380
PLANE AGE: INTRODUCED IN 2007
PLANE CAPACITY: 853 PASSENGERS

... (information for other airplanes) ...
```

## Structure Definition

The `Plane` structure has the following members:

- `name` (char[50]): Name of the airplane.
- `plane_number` (char[10]): Unique identifier for the airplane.
- `age` (char[50]): Introduction age of the airplane.
- `capacity` (char[50]): Passenger capacity of the airplane.

## Notes

- Modify the `flyers` array in `main()` to add or update airplane information as needed.
- This program demonstrates basic usage of structs and string manipulation in C.

Feel free to modify and use this program for educational or informational purposes related to airplanes and data structures in C.
